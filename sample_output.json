      "Summary": "# Main idea\nEarly perceptions of Çağlar Çorumlu as an always-joking comedian contrast with his actual calm, focused working style; early experiences and collaborations shaped mutual trust on set.\n\n## Key points\n- First impressions on set\n  - Others initially expected constant pranks and high-energy humor, but he proved reserved, attentive, and respectful of roles and time.\n- Early connections to comedy teams\n  - Mentions engaging with the \"7 Numara\" team and later \"Güldür Güldür,\" reflecting a trajectory from eager script-reader to recognized performer.\n- Building comfort and trust\n  - Though shy at first, he relaxes into the work; the interviewer felt relief upon realizing he’s measured and not disruptive, which set the tone for productive collaboration."

      "Summary": "# Main idea\nComedy for Çağlar is a craft executed with purpose and professionalism, not a perpetual persona; he prioritizes doing the job well, safety, and respect for colleagues over spontaneous showmanship.\n\n## Key points\n- Not confined to a \"comedian\" label\n  - He aims to perform roles in their best, truest form, regardless of genre, focusing on what the role requires rather than projecting a constant comic identity.\n- Improvisation needs purpose\n  - Spontaneous humor without an aim (e.g., a cause or clear narrative purpose) can be risky or belittling; \"Hadi bizi güldür\" expectations are dangerous without context.\n- Separating stage and life\n  - People often expect comedians to dominate social spaces with jokes; he rejects carrying performance energy into private life and prefers balanced, ordinary interactions.\n- Work ethic on set\n  - Values listening, concentration, and finishing tasks without wasting others’ time. Safety is paramount—jokes or delays shouldn’t endanger or inconvenience crew.\n- Maturity and humility\n  - Experience lowers the urge to \"prove\" oneself; he frames career growth alongside a personal journey, shaped by an upbringing of empathy (\"kimseyi kırma\"), which guides his conduct."

      "Summary": "# Main idea\nHe navigates the tension between respecting fans and honoring the crew’s time through empathy and clear communication.\n\n## Key points\n- Heavy workload realities\n  - Days of 10–12 pages, months of ~180 pages: such pace demands focus; spontaneous interruptions have real costs.\n- Real-time dilemmas\n  - Example: being asked for photos in public during work; saying \"abicim iş yapıyoruz\" can sound harsh, yet ignoring fans feels wrong.\n- Empathy as a guide\n  - Fans don’t see 40 crew waiting; acknowledging them (“bir saniye, hemen geliyorum”) can balance kindness with professional obligations.\n- Setting expectations early\n  - Upfront clarity about availability can prevent later conflicts and help both sides—audience goodwill and production continuity."

      "Summary": "# Main idea\nTheatre discipline and strong partnerships streamline performance, while digital production enables faster, coherent projects with fewer revisions.\n\n## Key points\n- Theatre-trained collaboration\n  - Working with \"Murat\" and theatre-oriented colleagues eases cues, timing, and mutual trust—vital for memorization and reactive performance.\n- First table read relief\n  - After months of writing, the first read felt smooth, confirming the material’s flow and reducing anxiety.\n- Digital’s practical advantages\n  - Previously, beloved scripts lingered or faced endless revisions; now, digital projects can proceed with remarkable speed and minimal changes."

      "Summary": "# Main idea\nDigital platforms reshape comedy: shorter, concentrated formats fit today’s viewing habits and reduce rating pressures, yet visibility challenges and market fragmentation persist.\n\n## Key points\n- Short-form reality\n  - Social media habits (often under a minute viewing) push comedy toward tighter, 15–20-minute episodes; teams are experimenting with this focus.\n- Pressure differences\n  - On TV shows like \"İyi Aile Babası,\" he felt constant pressure to maintain laughs; sketch work like \"Güldür Güldür\" felt lighter. Digital offers more breathing room and less ratings anxiety.\n- Platform constraints vs freedom\n  - TV’s 170-minute reality clashes with their 20-minute intent; digital fits their pacing and content better.\n- Discovery challenges\n  - Without ratings, some full-season drops attract little audience or feedback. More platforms mean more opportunities but also more unnoticed projects—underscoring the need to support quality digital work."

      },
      "Summary": "# Main idea\nHe reads quickly when possible and gravitates to coherent, purpose-built scripts; he resists projects pitched on personal ties or partial drafts.\n\n## Key points\n- Reading approach\n  - Often reads immediately and lets the text settle; if overwhelmed, he postpones to give it proper attention.\n- Why this project fit\n  - Not written expressly for him, yet the character/world were consistent, with set-ups and payoffs (espri geri dönüşleri), making it actor-attractive.\n- Selection criteria\n  - Prefers complete, thoughtfully structured scripts over 20-page fragments or vague ideas. Personal name-dropping (\"Çağlar’la aramız çok iyi\") doesn’t substitute for quality.\n- Volume and variety of pitches\n  - Receives many scripts—some strong, many weak; he emphasizes craft and completeness over networking or assumptions he’ll \"carry\" any comedy."
